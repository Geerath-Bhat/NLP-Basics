Today, we will be learning about how to loading pre-trained Machine Translation models to perform translation in a variety of languages. We will start by introducing the higher-level [Pipeline API](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/pipelines) that can be used to perform translation (or many other NLP tasks) by writing a couple of lines of code. We then remove the curtain from the Pipeline API and go into more internal details that are relevant for working with MT models in practice. \n","\n","Pre-requisites for the Tutorial:\n","- Intermediate Level Python Programming\n","- Working with Jupyter-Notebooks\n","\n","References:\n","1.

is now getting replace with a \"Prompting\" based approach. The idea behind prompting is that given a Large Language Model (LLM) trained on unlabelled (or labelled) text corpora, can be directly asked to do any task by specifying the instructions about the task in hand as a text description. This generally requires no updates to the parameters of the LLM and has been show competitive with fine-tuning based approaches on many tasks.

The idea behind evaluation is to have a numeric score representing how well the model is doing on the task of translation. As for other machine learning problems, to evaluate we use a labelled test dataset containing the original text and the reference translation created by human annotators. The translation produced by the MT system is compared with the reference translation to obtain the score representing the quality of translation. There are a number of different metrics that are used to measure this, some of which we will be discussing in detail in the next lecture. For this tutorial we will be focusing on BLEU score which on a very high level measures the n-gram overlap between the generated and reference translation. A BLEU score of 1 means perfect translation and 0 is the minimum score meaning no n-gram matches between the reference and generation. You can refer to this [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLEU) for more details.\n","\n","![image.png](attachment:98b8fc70-b69d-40c3-9c6d-df8ddf26107f.png)![image.png](attachment:5fc9684a-f37a-4cc0-a8cd-84ca299b000f.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Eko1A0NuUrNO"},"source":["We will first load the test dataset to use for evaluating the quality of translations.
